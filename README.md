# This is Kingsley's Naive Projects' Repository.

My English is still Too Simple, Sometimes Naive. So if you can't read what I am saying, Guan Wo Luan Shi.

This is used for some naive projects like some tools' demos, C++ dazuoye in grade one, etc.

## Update in 2016.12.12:
###A brief introduction of initial `maze.cpp`:
```
This is the initial program of our homework this semester, and the main process is:
    1. Initialize the two-dimensional array maze with 0s, while the dimensional range is: mazerange * mazerange;
    2. Set the outset and terminal position by changing the value of int variable: outsetx,outsety,terminalx,terminaly;
    3. Try to reach the terminal postion from the outset position with Depth-First-Search algorithm;
    4. The direction of search is arranged by: right-down-left-up;
    5. When the terminal is reached, print "Terminal Reached!" and exit the program;
    6. As you can see, this initial program is just a normal naive DFS program, and I will update to promote it later, maybe in winter vocation or sometime else when I am free.
```

## Update in 2016.12.14:
###A brief introduction of initial `RandRollcall.cpp`:
```
* This is the program I wrote in Grade Two in High school, as a tool for my teacher's rollcall;
* At present the program is only the demo I did then, and it doesn's fit in even other teachers' need. I will update it later so that it can fit in more situations.
* Todo: write a document to explain the main variables of the program and how to use it.
```

## Update in 2017.01.04:
###A brief introduction of initial `Battleship Game.py`:
```
# This was a program wrote when I learn Python on Codecademy 5 months ago, and I modified it later when I finished the course;
* It is now just a simple program withot GUI, I found it on my computer minutes ago and thought it is interseting anyway, so I uploaded it to Github;
* Todo: Update it into a program with GUI.
```
