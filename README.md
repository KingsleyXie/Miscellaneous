# This is Kingsley's Naive Projects' Repository.

My English is still Too Simple, Sometimes Naive. So if you can't read what I am saying, Guan Wo Luan Shi.

This is used for some naive projects like C++ dazuoye in Grade One, etc.

## Update in 2016.12.12:
###The brief introduction of initial maze.cpp:
>1. Initialize the two-dimensional array maze with 0s, while the dimensional range is: mazerange * mazerange;
>2. Set the outset and terminal position by changing the value of int variable: outsetx,outsety,terminalx,terminaly;
>3. Try to reach the terminal postion from the outset position with Depth-First-Search algorithm;
>4. The direction of search is arranged by: right-down-left-up;
>5. When the terminal is reached, print "Terminal Reached!" and exit the program;
>6. As you can see, this initial program is just a normal naive DFS program, and I will update to promote it later, maybe in winter vocation or sometime else when I am free.

## Update in 2016.12.14:
###The brief introduction of initial RandRollcall.cpp:
>1. This is the program I wrote in Grade Two in High school, as a tool for my teacher's rollcall;
>2. At present the program is only the demo I did then, and it doesn's fit in even other teachers' need. I will update it later so that it can fit in more situations.
>3. Todo: write a document to explain the main variables of the program and how to use it.
