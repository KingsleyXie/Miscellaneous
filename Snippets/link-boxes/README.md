### Brief Introduction
This is a responsive link-boxes snippet inspired by and modified from Typecho's link-box, initially used for the links page of friends on my blog. Actually it can also be used as an index page or other situations which requires a list of links.

Demo are shown at [https://demos.kingsleyxie.cn/link-boxes/](https://demos.kingsleyxie.cn/link-boxes/)

The [Alpha version](https://github.com/KingsleyXie/NaiveProjects/tree/c3c13f9/Snippets/link-boxes/) wrote with both CSS and JavaScript is also shown [here](https://demos.kingsleyxie.cn/link-boxes-alpha/), but it is deprecated since the CSS-only version now has a better performance.
